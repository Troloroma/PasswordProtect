What is PasswordProtect?
------------------------

PasswordProtect is a plugin for Bukkit, a new Minecraft server mod.

When enabled, users that join your server have to provide a password
before they can move around, build stuff, use items, commands, etc.

Ops can change the password, spawn jail area with the /setpassword and /setpasswordjail commands
